/*
 A linked list is a list constructed using pointers. It is not fixed in
 size and could grow and shrink while the program is running.
 
 A typical defination of list nodes contains at least two parts, both the
 content or date of each element and the pointer to the next element,
 which is shown in the figure below.
 
 +---------+
 |  Data   | -----> holds the data of this element in the list.
 +---------+
 | pointer | -----> is a pointer to the next element in the list.
 +---------+
 
 ***Attention***:
 The pointer holds the address of the next element, not the address of the
 data in the next element, even though they are the same in value sometimes.
 And It should be set to NULL while acting as the last node of the list.
 
 
 Implementation of the single linked list:
 +---------+    --->+---------+    --->+---------+
 |  Data   |    |   |  Data   |    |   |  Data   |
 +---------+    |   +---------+    |   +---------+
 | pointer |-----   | pointer |-----   | pointer |
